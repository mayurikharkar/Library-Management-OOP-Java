## ✨ Key Features

| # | Feature | OOP Concept | Class / Method |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Abstract `Book` superclass | **Abstraction** | `Book` (abstract) |
| 2 | `FictionBook` & `NonFictionBook` subclasses | **Inheritance** | `showDetails()` overrides |
| 3 | Private fields + getters/setters | **Encapsulation** | `Book` getters / `isBorrowed()` |
| 4 | Overridden `showDetails()` | **Polymorphism** | Each subclass prints its own info |
| 5 | Borrow / return with status tracking | State management | `borrow()`, `returnBook()` |
| 6 | Search by title or author (case‑insensitive) | Utility | `searchBooks()` |
| 7 | Simple menu‑driven CLI | User interaction | `LibrarySystem.start()` |
